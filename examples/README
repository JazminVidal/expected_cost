The following scripts create the plots and tables needed for the paper
"Analysis and Comparison of Classification Metrics", arXiv:2209.05355

PYTHONPATH=../ python bin_metric_comparison_from_conf_matrix.py
PYTHONPATH=../ python bin_metric_comparison_from_scores.py

Note that, unlike in the paper where class indices go from 1 to C, in
this code the class indices go from 0 to C-1 since python has 0-based
indexing.

The following scripts compute different variants of the expected cost, 
comparing results on raw and calibrated scores. The data used as input
can be changed to your own data (note that the some of the comments 
printed by scripts will no longer apply if you change the input data).

PYTHONPATH=../ python ec_analysis_for_a_2class_problem.py
PYTHONPATH=../ python ec_analysis_for_a_nclass_problem.py
