The following scripts create the plots and tables needed for the paper
"Analysis and Comparison of Classification Metrics", arXiv:2209.05355


PYTHONPATH=../ python bin_metric_comparison_from_conf_matrix.py
PYTHONPATH=../ python bin_metric_comparison_from_scores.py
PYTHONPATH=../ python ec_and_calibration_analysis.py

Note that, unlike in the paper where class indices go from 1 to C, in
this code the class indices go from 0 to C-1 since python has 0-based
indexing.

The data used as input to these scripts can be changed to your own data. To do
this, you can add a new option in the  methods in data.py. You can follow the
example corresponding to  cifar10.
